Focused characters
    One client that is connected to the server should be able to focus on one character at a time.
    Many clients should be able to connect to a server, and therefore many focused characters can happen in parallel.
    We'll have a mapping of client id to focused character tracking id that tells what character each client is focused to.
    Characters that a client logs into only exist in the world when the client is connected.
    NPCs exist in the world (and act though AI) as long as the server is up.
    The messages that a client receives is dependant on what the focused character is for that client.

Mercenaries
    Through adventure the player may meet NPCs that join their party as mercenaries.
    A NPC is cloned at the time they join the players party and the clone becomes a mercenary.
    Mercenaries only exist when the leading player is connected with their client.
    The leader of mercenaries can switch focus to any of their mercenaries.
    Mercenaries will usually have default behavior(s) when they are not focused.
    Players who do not lead mercenaries may not switch focus to them.
